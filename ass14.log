ERROR:root:Multithreading is a technique that enbles concurrent execution of multiple threads within a single process: 
ERROR:root:Advantages: 
ERROR:root:1. Increased performance: Multithreading can lead to increased performance by allowing multiple tasks to be executed simultaneously.This can lead to faster execution times and increased throughput.
ERROR:root:2. Improved responsiveness: BY execution tasks concurrently, multithreading can imporve the responsiveness of an application. for example, a GUI application can remain responsive while a time-consuming operation is executing in the background.
ERROR:root:3. Resource sharing: Multithreading allows threads to share resources such as memory, files, and network connections. This can reduce resource consumption and improve scability.
ERROR:root:4. Simplified program design: By breaking up a program into multiple threads, the program can be simplified and made more  modular, which can improve maintainbility and reduce development time.
ERROR:root:Disadvantages:
ERROR:root:1. Increased complexity: Multithreading can make a program more complex, as threads must be coordinated and synchronized to avoid conflicts and race conditions. This can make debugging and testing more difficult. 
ERROR:root:2. Synchronization overhead: Synchronization between threads can introduce overhead, as locks and other synchronization mechanisms must be used to ensure thread safety. This can reduce performance and increase the complexity of the code.
ERROR:root:3. Deadlocks: If threads are not properly synchronized, deadlocks can occur where two or more threads are waiting for each other to release resources.
ERROR:root:4. Increased resource consumption: Multithreading can increase resouce consumption, as multiple threads require additional resouces such as memory and CPU time.
ERROR:root:Deadlocks occurs when two or more processes are waiting for each other to release resources that they need in order to proceed.This creates a circular dependency, where each process is blocked waiting for a resource that is held by another process. Deadlocks can cause a system to become unresponsive or even crash. To avoid deadlocks, it is important to ensure that resources are properly managed and released when they are no longer needed.
ERROR:root:Race condition occur when two or more processes access shared resources in a way that produces unexpected result. for example, if two processes try to write to the same varriable at the same time, the final value of that variable will depend on which process finishes first. This can lead to bugs that are difficult to diagnose and reproduce. to avoid race conditions, it is important to use synchronization mechanisms such as locks or semaphores to ensure that shared resources are accessed in a multually exclusive manner.
